<h1>Programa de Control de Producci√≥n</h1>

This was one of the biggest projects on SQL that I participated on.  This SQL was implemented in Firebird/Interbase and it was connected to a DLL that improved the speed of certain processes.  I have to admit that some tables were redundant but it was made by short time for delivering by the contractor.  I suggested the contractor to work in a second edition of this project but he said that money was more important than quality.  I had it on my google drive account but now you can take a look.
